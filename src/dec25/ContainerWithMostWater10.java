 * Greedy Algorithm
 * @author Paul Qi
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
 * n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
 * Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 * Note: You may not slant the container. (height * width = container)
 * 
 * brute force O(n^2)
 * 
 * I don't find a good way to divide and conquer, because I cannot find a good way to combine the result
 * I try to order the height based on the height, still I cannot find a good way to reduct from O(n^2) to ??
